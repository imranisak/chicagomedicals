Why won't github let me edit the description?
So, this is my first "real" project made in vanilla PHP.
Because of that, most of the code is kinda awful. While it works with the things it has, it can definitely be made better. That's why I'm setting this repo as public, and all of this will be remade in Laravel soon.

Please, don't judge too hard.
